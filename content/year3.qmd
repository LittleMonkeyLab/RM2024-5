### Reading and Resource List

We have a custom made textbook to support key study skills throughout
your degree:
=======
title: Rendering with Code
---

You can have code (R, Python or Julia) in your qmd file. You will need
to have these installed on your local computer, but presumably you do
already if you are adding code to your qmd files.

```{r echo=TRUE}
x <- c(5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55)
y <- c(5, 20, 14, 32, 22, 38)
lm(x ~ y)
```

## Modify the GitHub Action

You will need to change the GitHub Action in `.github/workflows` to
install these and any needed packages in order for GitHub to be able to
render your webpage. The GitHub Action install R since I used that in
`code.qmd`. If you use Python or Julia instead, then you will need to
update the GitHub Action to install those.

If getting the GitHub Action to work is too much hassle (and that
definitely happens), you can alway render locally and publish to the
`gh-pages` branch. If you do this, make sure to delete or rename the
GitHub Action to something like

    render-and-publish.old_yml

so GitHub does not keep trying to run it. Nothing bad will happen if you
don't do this, but if you are not using the action (because it keeps
failing), then you don't need GitHub to run it.

## Render locally and publish to gh-pages branch

To render locally and push up to the `gh-pages` branch, open a terminal
window and then `cd` to the directory with the Quarto project. Type this
in the terminal:

    quarto render gh-pages
