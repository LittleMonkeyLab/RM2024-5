### Module Content

This module equips students with the practical and conceptual skills
necessary for the effective study of psychology. It includes computer
skills, presenting results of experiments, structuring an essay, and
critiquing a scientific paper. Additionally, it provides an introduction
to experimental design, data, and statistics in psychology. Students
will learn the theoretical aspects of basic statistical concepts and
tests, and gain experience using statistical packages.

### Module Learning Outcomes

The student should be able to:

demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the principles of
experimental psychology, from reading and summarizing scientific papers
to planning, writing and presenting essays, reports and presentations.

understand the importance and relevance of data analysis, the different
types of experiments and tests used.

understand the philosophical underpinnings of qualitative and
quantitative approaches to research and evaluate their merits.

demonstrate the skills to analyse and interpret data using qualitative
and quantitative frameworks and methods.

demonstrate statistical proficiency in the ability to use R to compute
summary statistics, z-scores, chi-square, binomial tests, and parametric
and non-parametric comparison of two means.

be able to visualise and present/communicate research findings to a
range of audiences

select and provide a rationale for using a statistical test to analyse a
particular dataset, and present the results correctly in both graphical
and APA format.

## Edit and add your pages

Edit the qmd or md files in the `content` folder. qmd files can include
code (R, Python, Julia) and lots of Quarto markdown bells and whistles
(like call-outs, cross-references, auto-citations and much more).

Each page should start with

    ---
    title: your title
    ---

and the first header will be the 2nd level, so `##`. Note, there are
situations where you leave off

    ---
    title: your title
    ---

and start the qmd file with a level header `#`, but if using the default
title yaml (in the `---` fence) is a good habit since it makes it easy
for Quarto convert your qmd file to other formats (like into a
presentation).

## Add your pages the project

-   Add the files to `_quarto.yml`
