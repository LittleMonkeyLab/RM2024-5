## Year 2 (level 5)

### Module aims

Experimental designs in psychology typically employ statistical analyses
such as analysis of variance, factor analysis and regression. The aim of
this module is to make these topics more accessible through the use of
practical examples and data collection on a self-directed group research
project.

### Module Content

The module's overall aim is to offer a supportive and intellectually
rigorous environment allowing students to develop highly valuable,
transferrable research and collaboration skills in the context of
undertaking a group research project.

This module teaches fundamental empirical research techniques within the
framework of Open Science and reproducibility, promoting best practice
in study design, Open Materials and Data, and methodological practice.
This module fully immerses students in the Goldsmiths 'community of
practice,' providing structured research support and opportunities to
reflect on learning, modelling the key milestones of the final year
dissertation.

The module seeks to promote the application of a scientific,
intellectually virtuous, research-based approach to any and all future
endeavours, and integrates metacognitive and reflective practices to
deliver this transformative learning towards academic and personal
development.

Over the course of two terms students will follow a programme of
lectures introducing a critical approach to psychological research, as
well as how such skills can be transferred beyond psychology; across
academic disciplines and into the everyday world, with extensive use of
case studies and problem-based learning.

Structured weekly labs will enable students to work collaboratively to
identify an area of research, critically evaluate current research in
the area, and develop a modest research project building on these
insights.

Students will work together, alongside lab tutors and researchers in the
department, to design and deliver the research project, including
obtaining ethical approval, data collection and analysis, then
interpreting and writing up the results, and sharing the materials and
data in line with Open Science best practices in the Psychological,
Behavioural and Data Sciences.

### Module Learning Outcomes

1.  Show a critical understanding of research design and methodology

2.  Design, conduct, analyse, interpret and disseminate a psychological
    research project

3.  Understand the conceptual and historical issues concerned with
    psychology as a science and area of practical application

4.  Demonstrate valuable time-management and collaborative
    project-management skills and proficiencies

5.  Reflect on their own learning, skill development and metacognition,
    preparing them for the final year dissertation

6.  be able to use R to analyse: regression, correlations, reliability
    and validity, effect sizes, one-way within and between subjects
    designs (and post-hocs), two-way within, between and mixed designs;
    and factor analysis

7.  Be able to present reproducible, APA format literate-programmed
    research reports.

### Reading and Resource List

We have a custom made textbook to support key study skills throughout
your degree:

title: "Set-up"

This is a template for a simple Quarto book output to html, PDF or docx
format. It includes a GitHub Action that will build the website
automatically when you make changes to the files. The NOAA palette and
fonts has been added to `theme.scss`. The webpage will be on the
`gh-pages` branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a
common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main
branch.

The GitHub Action installs R so you can have R code in your qmd or Rmd
files. Note, you do not need to make changes to your Rmd files unless
your need Quarto features like cross-references.

## GitHub Set-up

-   Click the green "use template" button to make a repository with this
    content. Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages
    doesn't work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and
    check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages
    branch).

-   Turn on GitHub Pages under Settings \> Pages . You will set pages to
    be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory.

-   Edit the repo description and Readme to add a link to the webpage.
    When you edit the description, you will see the link url in the url
    box or you can click on the Actions tab or the Settings \> Pages
    page to find the url.
