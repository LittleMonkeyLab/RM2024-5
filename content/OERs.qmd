## Overarching goals

### Accessibility for our students

They don't buy textbooks, and jumping from webpage to webpage for stats
support (for example) leads to more confusion than clarity. With the
move to R, this means that our entire teaching of RM is 'Open source'
and best of class. It's also cheaper for the student now and for ever,
as it can be accessed through a browser, as a pdf, or as a number of
different formats depending on taste.

We can also make sure that it is Text-reader friendly, dyslexia
friendly, colourblind accessible, appropriate in terms of terminology
and examples (e.g. Gender/Sexuality) etc.

### This is a marketing opportunity

If we are able to encapsulate some of the Goldsmiths vibe, it is likely
to be a very positive reflection of our programme. We can make a point
to include elements that showcase our qualities, and advertise our
culture/strengths. The University of Glasgow has won acclaim for their
2017 exercise to move to R and to open teaching resources. Have a look
at some of them here. They are pretty cool, but VERY dry - mostly data
wrangling and very little actual Psychology...

### Cost implication

A range of free resources will be something that we can be proud to give
to our students. If we are able to show that they are also
high-quality... winner.

## Process

### Remix

I propose a 'Goldsmiths Remix' of existing resources, assembled from the
wide variety of Research Methods, Statistics and general Psychology
texts available. With a relatively small amount of effort, an initial
version can be produced in the time available.

Remixing is a recognised and respectable enterprise. The only proviso is
that if you choose to remix content, you have to 'share-alike' i.e.
publish it in a similar open way. I do not see this as a problem.

We shall make sure to only remix quality content.

There is oodles of Quant and General Psych material to choose from.
Qualitative work is a bit thinner on the ground. We have the opportunity
to steal a march in this area potentially with an exciting 'methods
neutral' toolkit.

### Student participation

Ideally we would have students involved in the production of the
resources, and make sure that they integrate newer technologies to make
them 'living documents'. Current best practice is to host texts in
GitHub repositories, inviting comments or edits, but also to employ
social annotation tools (such as Hypothes.is https://web.hypothes.is/) -
which allows webpages to be annotated wither publicly or privately, and
for communities to be built around what might be considered a static
resource.

### Walking the walk

An ideal platform on which to build the book is Quarto, and indeed, due
to the relative recency of the RMarkdown to Quarto shift, we will be
amongst the first to develop a Psychology offering of this type. And
since Quarto is proposed as a platform by which to support student
writing, it shows expertise and commitment to what we are training.

### If a job's worth doing...

With a little love, humour and creativity we could make our texts (and
resources - Lectures/Labs/Datasets etc) more engaging than many others
available. Indeed, if we make a concerted effort, it might be that we
could
