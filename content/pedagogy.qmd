# one word... FUN!!!

Labs should be Practical first.

And nothing that isn't 100% Goldsmiths or impossible to do at school. No
more Milgram.

Flipped stats with screencasts and scaffolded tutorials - regular drop
ins and forums

Evidence suggests that a flipped approach to teaching statistics
significantly improves student performance (across a range of metrics)
at the mean and throughout the achievement distribution, while
controlling for baseline student characteristics @sathy2020 (see tables
13.3 & 13.4 - specifically Anxiety, preparedness and under-represented
minority status).

## Teaching and Assessment

Through lectures, interactive group discussions, online skills
development modules, and practical lab sessions, we will ignite your
enthusiasm for Psychology and Behavioural Science research and help you
develop the fundamental skills, knowledge - and confidence - required to
become a Psychology literate, disruptive scientist of the future. Tada!

## A few words on Assessment

"Authentic assessment" generally refers to assignments that reflect the
skills students will use in their post-graduation careers and life more
generally. This is distinct from traditional assessments such as
closed-book exams and academic essays.

For psychology, authentic assessments may involve the development of
traditional science communication skills, such as lab reports, however
there is a broader portfolio to choose from! In clinical psychology,
Authentic challenges could include formulation of case studies or mock
practitioner dialogues. Common challneges for many professions include
writing for non-expert audiences, critical evaluation of media materials
or the production of media materials that are rigorous... Reflective
accounts and portfolios are part of a number of later training roles and
research interviews are a hugely powerful transferable skill! All of
these are designed to promote psychological literacy by encouraging
communication with non-experts and application of psychology content.

Blog writing may be an effective assessment for capturing and promoting
students' psychological literacy. They are also increasingly popular for
assessing writing ability and conceptual knowledge. Blog writing may
help students take different perspectives, develop a critical appraisal
of content, and become more reflective. Given the currency of blogging
and the fact that it is a core channel for marketing and social media -
it a rich target that assesses a distinctive set of skills. Students
seem to enjoy it too.

Blog writing may help students overcome the challenge of academic essay
writing (Ishak & Salter, 2017) since it is less rigidly governed by
academic norms (Bennett et al., 2012) and involves more reflective,
creative, and critical tone (Arslan & Aysel, 2010; Novakovich & Long,
2013). It also provides an opportunity to communicate psychology content
to a wider audience (Gardiner et al., 2018; Schmidt, 2008; Relojo,
2017). It has been embedded successfully in many different subjects in
higher education, such as pharmacy (Dunne & Ryan, 2016), anthropology
(Walker & Chatzigavriil, 2017), professional development (Shanks, 2020),
and English literature (Agarwal, 2017). The British Psychological
Society, 2019 and the American Psychological Association (2013) stress
the importance of critical evaluation and reflection, which is
compatible with blog writing. Research shows that blog writing prompts
critical thinking and reflection (Chretien et al., 2008; Novakovich,
2016). Challenges to implementing blog writing as an assessment include
students having little to no previous experience (Kerawalla et al.,
2009). Blog writing should be grounded effectively in course materials,
have clear expectations, and be understood through a lens of
psychological literacy (Cranney et al., 2008, 2012). We propose that
blog writing may provide a useful opportunity to allow students to apply
their psychology content in a critical, creative, and non-conventional
way.

## Technical Overview

### Technical Overview

![](/images/R_logo.png){width="100"}R is primarily a computer
programming language for statistical analysis. It is *free*, and
*open-source* (many people contribute to developing it), and runs on
most operating systems or through an internet browser, and so there are
few obstacles to its use by the normal undergraduate population (compare
to SPSS).

It is a powerful language that can be used for all sorts of mathematical
operations, data-processing, analysis, and graphical display of data -
it is used more a more frequently in corporate settings, unlike 'pay to
play' software such as SPSS.

I even used R to write this lab manual. And, I use R all the time for my
own research, because it makes data-analyis fast, efficient,
transparent, reproducible, and exciting

![](/images/posit_logo.png){width="100"}

Posit is name of the Integrated Development Environment in which the R
Language (and Python/Julia/Observable+) are run. It is Open Source and
offers free access to everyone.

Posit Cloud is a paid-for service that allows users to access the Posit
environment without downloading anything - it's browser based, and you
can run analysis and create publication-ready documents on your phone.

Posit Cloud would likely be my suggestion as to the infrastructure we
employ.

Free accounts are available to all students for a processing duration of
25 project hours per month, with free hosting of published content.
Instructors pay a small amount, and it can be arranged that payment is
made by student, instructor or organisation if a student were to exceed
their Posit Cloud allowance.

The point is important to make however, that energised users simply have
to download and install the free software and they can use it as much as
they want, thus the high-rate users usually, very quickly, wean
themselves off the browser-based platform.

The Posit Cloud has classroom functionality and is designed to deliver
teaching, tutorials and content

![](/images/quarto_logo.png){width="150"}

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system
built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). Quarto documents are authored
using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), an easy to
write plain text format.

In addition to the core capabilities of Pandoc, Quarto includes:

1.  Embedding code and output from Python, R, Julia, and JavaScript via
    integration with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/),
    [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/), and
    [Observable](https://github.com/observablehq/).

2.  A variety of extensions to Pandoc markdown useful for technical
    writing including cross-references, sub-figures, layout panels,
    hoverable citations and footnotes, callouts, and more.

3.  A project system for rendering groups of documents at once, sharing
    options across documents, and producing aggregate output like
    [websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) and
    [books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/).

4.  Authoring using a wide variety of editors and notebooks including
    [JupyterLab](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html),
    [RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html), and [VS
    Code](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html).

5.  A [visual markdown editor](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/)
    that provides a productive writing interface for composing long-form
    documents.
