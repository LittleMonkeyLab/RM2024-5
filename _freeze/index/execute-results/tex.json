This includes the ability to understand how psychological processes and phenomena influence our behavior, emotions, thoughts, and relationships. It also includes the capacity to use psychological knowledge to make informed decisions and to better understand, explain, and predict the behavior of self and others.\n\nPsychology graduates are highly sought after by employers due to their ability to formulate and communicate well-reasoned, evidence-based, and statistically defensible arguments based on their expertise in the study of human behavior and its causes. On top of this, psychology graduates possess the skills to work independently or collaboratively, as well as strong numerical capabilities, verbal and written communication skills, and an up-to-date knowledge of digital technologies applicable to a wide range of occupational fields.\n\n## General Information\n\nIntended Learning OutcCreate reproducible data analysis scripts and reports within the R statistical programming environment.\n\nQAA Benchmarks\n\nSubject Knowledge and Understanding\n\n6.3.4 demonstrate detailed knowledge of several specialised areas and/or applications, some of which are at the cutting edge of research in the discipline\n\n6.3.5 demonstrate a systematic knowledge of a range of research paradigms, research methods and measurement techniques, including statistics and probability, and be aware of their limitations.\n\nSubject-specific skills\n\nPS510XX - RM1 - Introduction to Research Methods and Data Skills\n\nPS520XX - RM2 - Research Methods in Practice and Data Skills\n\nPS530XX - RM3 - Research Project Incubator\n\n\\*PS710XX - Practical Research Skills\n\nLectures - Overview of key concepts/context and preview Lab practicals / Data Skills\n\nLabs - Practical or activity based (inc.
