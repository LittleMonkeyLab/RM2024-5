Tada!\n\n\nAUTHENTIC ASSESSMENT - OPenAI\n“Authentic assessment” generally refers to assignments that reflect the skills students will use in their post-graduation careers and life experiences (Archbald, 1991; Gulikers et al., 2004). This is distinct from traditional assessments such as closed-book exams and academic essays (Macandrew & Edwards, 2002). For psychology, authentic assessments may involve the development of scientific inquiry skills, such as a practical research report (Halonen et al., 2003). In clinical psychology, this can include formulation of case studies or mock practitioner dialogues (Villarroel et al., 2018). Other examples of authentic assessments include writing letters to non-psychology audiences (Cranney, 2013), critical evaluation of media materials (Halpern & Butler, 2011), written reflections of volunteering (Hadlington; as cited in Taylor & Hulme, 2015), and research project interviews (Turner & Davila-Ross, 2015). All of these are designed to promote psychological literacy by encouraging communication with non-experts and application of psychology content (Hulme, 2014).\nCentral to psychological literacy is the effective communication of psychology in practice (Trapp et al., 2011). To this end, blog writing may be an effective assessment for capturing and promoting students’ psychological literacy. Blogs are a web-based form of journal or writing platform, and are useful for disseminating information (Richardson, 2006). They are also increasingly popular for assessing written language skills (Kim, 2008; Lee, 2010; Raith, 2009; Williams & Jacobs, 2004). Blog writing may help students take different perspectives, develop a critical appraisal of content, and become more self-reflective (Frye et al., 2010; Jimoyiannis & Angelaina, 2012). It also empowers and engages students (Creme & Hunt, 2002), a core goal of psychology education (Ishak & Salter, 2017). It enhances academic language learning (Murray et al., 2007) and assesses different skills than traditional forms of assessment (Morris et al., 2013). Studies show that students report high levels of engagement with blog writing (Hindley, 2018).\nBlog writing may help students overcome the challenge of academic essay writing (Ishak & Salter, 2017) since it is less rigidly governed by academic norms (Bennett et al., 2012) and involves more reflective, creative, and critical tone (Arslan & Aysel, 2010; Novakovich & Long, 2013). It also provides an opportunity to communicate psychology content to a wider audience (Gardiner et al., 2018; Schmidt, 2008; Relojo, 2017). It has been embedded successfully in many different subjects in higher education, such as pharmacy (Dunne & Ryan, 2016), anthropology (Walker & Chatzigavriil, 2017), professional development (Shanks, 2020), and English literature (Agarwal, 2017). The British Psychological Society, 2019 and the American Psychological Association (2013) stress the importance of critical evaluation and reflection, which is compatible with blog writing. Research shows that blog writing prompts critical thinking and reflection (Chretien et al., 2008; Novakovich, 2016). Challenges to implementing blog writing as an assessment include students having little to no previous experience (Kerawalla et al., 2009). Blog writing should be grounded effectively in course materials, have clear expectations, and be understood through a lens of psychological literacy (Cranney et al., 2008, 2012). We propose that blog writing may provide a useful opportunity to allow students to apply their psychology content in a critical, creative, and non-conventional way.\n\nOPENAIabove\n\nBPS Guidelines from OpenAI\n1.

Research methods are integral to Psychology and students obtain a sound knowledge of, and a proven ability to use, a range of methods appropriately. Knowledge and understanding of how to obtain and analyse evidence is best acquired and demonstrated through extensive and progressive empirical work in laboratory and naturalistic settings through all stages of a degree. [section 3.4 Subject Benchmark Statement] Psychology students learn the basic principles of sound data collection. Given the broad theoretical scope of Psychology, rigorous specialist training is required to engender a critical understanding of the role of experimental design, the choice of research methods employed, and the analytic approach taken, for testing psychological theories. [section 3.5 Subject Benchmark Statement] Programmes’ coverage of research methods should support students’ engagement with the sub-areas listed above, and should be directed towards supporting students’ attainment of the subject-specific skills highlighted in section 4.4 of the Subject Benchmark Statement. As they progress through the programme, students should be able to: • apply multiple perspectives to psychological issues, recognising that psychology involves a range of research methods, theories, evidence and applications; • integrate ideas and findings across the multiple perspectives in psychology and recognise distinctive psychological approaches to relevant issues; • identify and evaluate patterns in behaviour, psychological functioning and experience; • generate and explore hypotheses and research questions drawing on relevant theory and research; • carry out empirical studies involving a variety of methods of data collection, including experiments, observation, questionnaires, interviews and focus groups; • analyse, present and evaluate quantitative and qualitative data and evaluate research findings; • employ evidence-based reasoning and examine practical, theoretical and ethical issues associated with the range of methodologies; • use a variety of psychological tools, including specialist software, laboratory equipment and psychometric instruments; • apply psychological knowledge ethically and safely to real world problems; and • critically evaluate psychological theory and research.\n\n\nCommunicate complex information effectively using appropriate written, oral, graphical and electronic means, taking into account diversity among individuals to whom the information is communicated.\nExplain the potential impact of psychological research and theory on a broad range of real world settings and situations (e.g., classrooms, industry, commerce, healthcare, as well as local and global communities).\nProblem-solve and reason scientifically. Specifically, graduates will be able to identify and pose research questions, consider alternative approaches to their solutions, and evaluate outcomes.\nBe sensitive to contextual and interpersonal factors. Graduates will be familiar with the complexity of the factors that shape behaviour and social interaction which, in turn, will make them more aware of the bases of problems and interpersonal conflicts.\nor Be a self-critical learner, showing sensitivity to contextual and interpersonal factors. Graduates will be familiar with the complexity of the factors that shape behaviour and social interaction which, in turn, will make them more aware of the bases of problems and interpersonal conflicts.\nShow an understanding of various research paradigms, methods, and evaluation procedures, including statistical analysis, as well as their constraints.\nDesign, carry out, evaluate and interpret scientifically rigorous and ethically sound studies both independently and collaboratively, utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods, statistical analysis and modern digital software.\nPsychological literacy is the ability to understand and apply psychological principles and theories to everyday life. This includes the ability to understand how psychological processes and phenomena influence our behavior, emotions, thoughts, and relationships. It also includes the capacity to use psychological knowledge to make informed decisions and to better understand, explain, and predict the behavior of self and others.\nPsychology graduates are highly sought after by employers due to their ability to formulate and communicate well-reasoned, evidence-based, and statistically defensible arguments based on their expertise in the study of human behavior and its causes. On top of this, psychology graduates possess the skills to work independently or collaboratively, as well as strong numerical capabilities, verbal and written communication skills, and an up-to-date knowledge of digital technologies applicable to a wide range of occupational fields.\n\nIntended Learning Outcomes\nIntended Learning Outcomes\nCreate reproducible data analysis scripts and reports within the R statistical programming environment.\nQAA Benchmarks\nSubject Knowledge and Understanding\n6.3.4 demonstrate detailed knowledge of several specialised areas and/or applications, some of which are at the cutting edge of research in the discipline 6.3.5 demonstrate a systematic knowledge of a range of research paradigms, research methods and measurement techniques, including statistics and probability, and be aware of their limitations.\nSubject-specific skills\nPS510XX - RM1 - Introduction to Research Methods and Data Skills\nPS520XX - RM2 - Research Methods in Practice and Data Skills\nPS530XX - RM3 - Research Project Incubator\n*PS710XX - Practical Research Skills\nLectures - Overview of key concepts/context and preview Lab practicals / Data Skills\nLabs - Practical or activity based (inc.

In general psychology, for example, authentic assessments may include the explicit development of scientific inquiry skills, such as a practical research report (Halonen et al., 2003). Or, for more applied facets such as clinical psychology, this may also include formulation of case studies or engagement in mock practitioner dialogues (Villarroel et al., 2018). Previous examples of authentic assessments designed to foster and assess psychological literacy include asking students to write letters to non-psychology audiences (Cranney, 2013), critical evaluation of media materials (Halpern & Butler, 2011), written reflections of volunteering (Hadlington; as cited in Taylor & Hulme, 2015), and research project interviews (Turner & Davila-Ross, 2015). All of these examples are designed to encourage a psychologically literate approach to psychology content because they encourage communication with non-experts and application of psychology content (Hulme, 2014).\nIndeed, central to the notion of psychological literacy is the effective communication of psychology in practice (Trapp et al., 2011). Therefore, a psychologically literate education should encourage students to communicate their knowledge in clear and accessible ways. With this in mind, here, we propose that blog writing may also be an effective assessment for capturing and promoting students’ psychological literacy. Blog writing inherently aligns with the agenda of psychological literacy because it aims to communicate often complex psychology knowledge in an accessible way (Jolley et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2007).\nPrimary Citation Pownall et al. (2023) Blogs, which are a web-based form of journal or writing platform, are a powerful tool in the wide dissemination of information in the modern media mix - relevant to current students (Richardson, 2006) .\nBlog writing is thought to offer the opportunity to take different perspectives in writing, develop a more critical appraisal of the content, and thus can prompt higher levels of self-reflection (e.g., Frye et al., 2010; Jimoyiannis & Angelaina, 2012). Activities that encourage creative participation in the process of academic writing have been found to empower and engage students (Creme & Hunt, 2002), a core goal of a psychology education (Ishak & Salter, 2017). Therefore, blog writing promotes wider academic language learning (Murray et al., 2007) and thus complements more traditional forms of assessments by allowing a different set of skills to be assessed (Morris et al., 2013). Across the literature, studies show that students report high levels of engagement with blog writing exercises, owing to the high levels of creativity associated with this form of writing (Hindley, 2018).\nResearch demonstrates students often report feeling unprepared and overwhelmed at the perceived “rules” of academic essay writing (Ishak & Salter, 2017). Blog writing should help students to overcome this pedagogic challenge, given that blogs are governed less rigidly by academic norms (Bennett et al., 2012) and typically involve more reflective, creative, and critical tone (Arslan & Aysel, 2010; Novakovich & Long, 2013). Writing in a clear and accessible way is an important transferable skill and undergraduate outcomes across subjects in higher education (Hawkey & Barker, 2004; Leki & Carson, 1994). Blog writing can, in theory, enhance these skills, given its highly reflective nature and deviance away from the conventions of academic writing with which some students struggle (Dippold, 2009; Soysa et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2008). Similarly, blog writing also provides a useful opportunity to communicate psychology content to a wider audience. Scholars have noted how traditional forms of academic psychology dissemination, such as journal articles, are typically inaccessible to a general audience, both in terms of language use and access (i.e., because they are published behind a paywall that requires institutional subscriptions; Relojo, 2017). Blog writing may thus be an important platform to mediate the relationship between science and the general public (e.g., Gardiner et al., 2018; Schmidt, 2008), which again is a facet of the psychological literacy approach (Hulme, 2014).\nBlog writing as an assessment has been embedded successfully in many different academic subjects in higher education, such as in pharmacy (Dunne & Ryan, 2016), anthropology (Walker & Chatzigavriil, 2017), professional development (Shanks, 2020), and English literature (Agarwal, 2017). Indeed, given that the British Psychological Society, 2019 note in their degree accreditation standards that “critical evaluation and reflection” is a key graduate attribute for psychology programs, blog writing may be particularly compatible with psychology undergraduate content. The blog approach to writing has been promoted through BPS-led initiatives, such as the Voices in Psychology program (Sutton & Pownall, 2018, 2019). This also extends to the American Psychological Association’s guidelines for undergraduate psychology majors (2013), who too stress that scientific inquiry, critical thinking, and communication are among the core goals of a psychology degree.\nMoreover, research shows that blog writing prompts critical thinking and reflection (Chretien et al., 2008; Novakovich, 2016). For example, Novakovich (2016) investigated whether there are differences in the quality of writing generated through in-class workshops between the use of traditional methods compared with blog writing. They concluded that blog writing fostered more complex literacy skills, which is echoed by other empirical studies (e.g., Alsamadani, 2018; Febianti & Wahyuni, 2019).\nHowever, there are also some challenges in implementing blogs as an effective assessment format. For example, students often have little to no previous experience of blogging which can impede engagement with it as an assessment (Kerawalla et al., 2009). Similarly, Kerawalla et al. (2009) warned that blog writing as an assessment in higher education should be grounded effectively in the course materials; without an effective sense of purpose, blogs as an assessment can be perceived as lacking clarity about their function, audience, and tone. Therefore, the expectations of blog writing should be made clear to students. Given the necessary alignment with subject-specific degree outcomes, blog writing may be best understood through a lens of psychological literacy, given that this approach encourages psychology students to apply their knowledge to daily life (Cranney et al., 2008, 2012). Therefore, we propose that blog writing may provide a useful opportunity to allow students to apply their psychology content in a critical, creative, non-conventional way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog Rubric example\n\n\n\nScientific Blog marking rubric\nBelow are the grading criteria for the assessment of the science blog. The profiles give an\nindication of typical performance at each class band, and clearly permit some variations upwards\nor downwards while remaining in the same class band. These descriptions should be taken as\nindicative rather than prescriptive. Seven key attributes of written work are considered when\nassigning marks, with some (e.g., ‘accuracy’) clearly more important than others:\n\nAccuracy (i.e., is the material reported accurately?)\nAppropriateness for general audience (i.e., is key content well defined and explained, could a\nnon-specialist follow the argument)\nApplication to question (i.e., is the material used effectively in the assignment)\nEvidence (i.e., are claims supported by relevant evidence and/or theory from the literature?)\nArgument (i.e., is there a convincing line of argument through the work?)\nCritical evaluation (i.e., is the material presented evaluated fully?)\nStructure and coherence (i.e., is the answer well-structured with good flow between points?)\nPresentation (i.e., is the clarity of expression good)\n\nSee accompanying website for Rubric or go here https://osf.io/rgf8t\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"quarto-navigation-envelope\" class=\"hidden\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"hidden\" data-render-id=\"quarto-int-sidebar-title\"&gt;Draft Proposal - Goldsmiths Research Methods in Psychology&lt;/span&gt;

The aim of this module is to make these topics more accessible through the use of practical examples and data collection on a self-directed group research project.\n\n\nModule Content\nThe module’s overall aim is to offer a supportive and intellectually rigorous environment allowing students to develop highly valuable, transferrable research and collaboration skills in the context of undertaking a group research project.\nThis module teaches fundamental empirical research techniques within the framework of Open Science and reproducibility, promoting best practice in study design, Open Materials and Data, and methodological practice. This module fully immerses students in the Goldsmiths ‘community of practice,’ providing structured research support and opportunities to reflect on learning, modelling the key milestones of the final year dissertation.\nThe module seeks to promote the application of a scientific, intellectually virtuous, research-based approach to any and all future endeavours, and integrates metacognitive and reflective practices to deliver this transformative learning towards academic and personal development.\nOver the course of two terms students will follow a programme of lectures introducing a critical approach to psychological research, as well as how such skills can be transferred beyond psychology; across academic disciplines and into the everyday world, with extensive use of case studies and problem-based learning.\nStructured weekly labs will enable students to work collaboratively to identify an area of research, critically evaluate current research in the area, and develop a modest research project building on these insights.\nStudents will work together, alongside lab tutors and researchers in the department, to design and deliver the research project, including obtaining ethical approval, data collection and analysis, then interpreting and writing up the results, and sharing the materials and data in line with Open Science best practices in the Psychological, Behavioural and Data Sciences.\n\n\nModule Learning Outcomes\n\nShow a critical understanding of research design and methodology\nDesign, conduct, analyse, interpret and disseminate a psychological research project\nUnderstand the conceptual and historical issues concerned with psychology as a science and area of practical application\nDemonstrate valuable time-management and collaborative project-management skills and proficiencies\nReflect on their own learning, skill development and metacognition, preparing them for the final year dissertation\nbe able to use R to analyse: regression, correlations, reliability and validity, effect sizes, one-way within and between subjects designs (and post-hocs), two-way within, between and mixed designs; and factor analysis\nBe able to present reproducible, APA format literate-programmed research reports.\n\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\n\nAssessment Element\nLength\n%\nF or S\nLO Tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading and Resource List\nWe have a custom made textbook to support key study skills throughout your degree:"
