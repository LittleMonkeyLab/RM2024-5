    "text": "Research Skills\nThe Psychology department at Goldsmiths has a number of differentiating features, upon which it must build in order to ensure it remains attractive and distinctive.\nResearch Methods has to be an adventure, “Alive” with enthusiasm, inspiring curiosity and intellectual problem-solving.\nWe have to break the A-Level preconception that Research Methods is dry, maths-like or indeed difficult.\nThis must be achieved by: - Practical First - The majority of lab sessions should be practical and ‘hands on’! - Only present research/methods/topics that are ‘ownable’ - where we have expertise, cachet and competitive advantage - and that could NOT be done at school - ‘Relevant & Applicable’ above all else. Nothing is taught ‘because the BPS says we have to’ or that doesn’t have widespread use in a range of future endeavours - Demonstrate and model intellectual virtue, curiosity, empiricism, skepticism, humility and\nPsychology can be a stimulating and joyful endeavour, and learning it is best achieved in a safe, but challenging environment."

    "text": "Weekly structure (all levels)\n\n2 hours lecture (+1 hour pre-reading)\nWe moved to 1 hour (from 2) during the pandemic, and it has severely limited the amount that can be reasonably covered. In addition to doubling the lecture time (as is merited by credit weighting alone), we propose to introduce a weekly expectation that an hour is spent reading in preparation for the following session.\nThis could be diverted to other preparatory activities, but the expectation will be clearly set that a MINIMUM of an hour of preparation is expected for every lecture.\n\n\n\n2 hours lab (+1 hour pre-reading)\nLabs are valuable practical sessions and a similar expectation exists that a student will have completed whatever preparation is expected. Of course, we understand if things don’t always go to plan, so if you can, please do turn up, but by being prepared, and understanding the activity being conducted, the learning outcomes are far more achievable.\nIt will often be the case the the preparation is mostly ‘setting the scene’, or giving detailed instructions about what will be happening that are better delivered in writing, or clarifying what you will be expected to have done or produced by the end of the lab.\nIn this module, it is easier to ‘keep up than catch up’.\n\n\n\n2 hours Interactive Data Skills Tutorials (with short weekly assessment)\nThink of this as focussed time students are dedicated to working on their computers, and so anything that sits within the browser is fair game here. It’s NOT just Stats. Library skills, literature searching, learning logs and portfolios, as well as collaborative writing or finding information.\nSince the programme will employ an Open Educational Resource Online Textbook as the central resource for Lectures and Labs, this means that the notional 4 hours of ‘screen time’ allocated to this module may often be closely aligned, but it will also be the case that a wide range of activity types will be trained and developed, including the Goldsmiths Library and their extensive online resources, also extensive use of Posit Cloud will be made, the hub where students will produce technical reports, blogs and webpages, conduct data analysis and collaborate on coding and writing exercises.\n\nMethod-neutral and wide Open!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanger\n\n\n\nWe embrace an Open Science approach in our efforts to cultivate your critical evaluation skills, enhance your understanding of the significance - and power - of research, and equip you with the necessary graduate-level skills to collect, handle, and interpret data using programming software for statistical model development, visualisation and analysis.\n\n\n\n\nHours specification (e.g.) Years 1 & 2\n\nNotional Hours = 300\n\n\nActivity\nTime\nNote\n\n\n\n\nLectures\n40\n2hrs/week\n\n\nLabs\n40\n2hrs/week\n\n\nData Skills (Online)\n40\n2hrs/week\n\n\nGuided Reading/viewing\n40\n2hrs/week\n\n\nRPS\n20\n1hr/week\n\n\nIndependent Study/Coursework\n120\n6hr/week"

    "text": "A few words on Assessment\n“Authentic assessment” generally refers to assignments that reflect the skills students will use in their post-graduation careers and life more generally. This is distinct from traditional assessments such as closed-book exams and academic essays.\nFor psychology, authentic assessments may involve the development of traditional science communication skills, such as lab reports, however there is a broader portfolio to choose from! In clinical psychology, Authentic challenges could include formulation of case studies or mock practitioner dialogues. Common challneges for many professions include writing for non-expert audiences, critical evaluation of media materials or the production of media materials that are rigorous… Reflective accounts and portfolios are part of a number of later training roles and research interviews are a hugely powerful transferable skill! All of these are designed to promote psychological literacy by encouraging communication with non-experts and application of psychology content.\nBlog writing may be an effective assessment for capturing and promoting students’ psychological literacy. They are also increasingly popular for assessing writing ability and conceptual knowledge. Blog writing may help students take different perspectives, develop a critical appraisal of content, and become more reflective. Given the currency of blogging and the fact that it is a core channel for marketing and social media - it a rich target that assesses a distinctive set of skills. Students seem to enjoy it too.\nBlog writing may help students overcome the challenge of academic essay writing (Ishak & Salter, 2017) since it is less rigidly governed by academic norms (Bennett et al., 2012) and involves more reflective, creative, and critical tone (Arslan & Aysel, 2010; Novakovich & Long, 2013). It also provides an opportunity to communicate psychology content to a wider audience (Gardiner et al., 2018; Schmidt, 2008; Relojo, 2017). It has been embedded successfully in many different subjects in higher education, such as pharmacy (Dunne & Ryan, 2016), anthropology (Walker & Chatzigavriil, 2017), professional development (Shanks, 2020), and English literature (Agarwal, 2017). The British Psychological Society, 2019 and the American Psychological Association (2013) stress the importance of critical evaluation and reflection, which is compatible with blog writing. Research shows that blog writing prompts critical thinking and reflection (Chretien et al., 2008; Novakovich, 2016). Challenges to implementing blog writing as an assessment include students having little to no previous experience (Kerawalla et al., 2009). Blog writing should be grounded effectively in course materials, have clear expectations, and be understood through a lens of psychological literacy (Cranney et al., 2008, 2012). We propose that blog writing may provide a useful opportunity to allow students to apply their psychology content in a critical, creative, and non-conventional way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandidate assessment types that we think could actually work!\n\n\n\nBlog\nPodcast\nWebsite\nPosters\nInformation Packs Macandrew & Edwards (2002)\nPortfolios (or ProcessFolio)\nInterview (and self-reflection)\nClinical Assessment\nSkills assessment\nOral Examination (mock job interview)\nSelf and Peer evaluation (360º)\nLiterature Search & Review (with or without annotations)\nAnnotated Code\nComputational documents (Lab Reports)\nDesign and Proposal (Pre-registration)\nData analysis (Results section)"

    "text": "Technical Overview\n\nTechnical Overview\nR is primarily a computer programming language for statistical analysis. It is free, and open-source (many people contribute to developing it), and runs on most operating systems or through an internet browser, and so there are few obstacles to its use by the normal undergraduate population (compare to SPSS).\nIt is a powerful language that can be used for all sorts of mathematical operations, data-processing, analysis, and graphical display of data - it is used more a more frequently in corporate settings, unlike ‘pay to play’ software such as SPSS.\nI even used R to write this lab manual. And, I use R all the time for my own research, because it makes data-analyis fast, efficient, transparent, reproducible, and exciting\n\nPosit is name of the Integrated Development Environment in which the R Language (and Python/Julia/Observable+) are run. It is Open Source and offers free access to everyone.\nPosit Cloud is a paid-for service that allows users to access the Posit environment without downloading anything - it’s browser based, and you can run analysis and create publication-ready documents on your phone.\nPosit Cloud would likely be my suggestion as to the infrastructure we employ.\nFree accounts are available to all students for a processing duration of 25 project hours per month, with free hosting of published content. Instructors pay a small amount, and it can be arranged that payment is made by student, instructor or organisation if a student were to exceed their Posit Cloud allowance.\nThe point is important to make however, that energised users simply have to download and install the free software and they can use it as much as they want, thus the high-rate users usually, very quickly, wean themselves off the browser-based platform.\nThe Posit Cloud has classroom functionality and is designed to deliver teaching, tutorials and content\n\n\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. Quarto documents are authored using markdown, an easy to write plain text format.\nIn addition to the core capabilities of Pandoc, Quarto includes:\n\nEmbedding code and output from Python, R, Julia, and JavaScript via integration with Jupyter, Knitr, and Observable.\nA variety of extensions to Pandoc markdown useful for technical writing including cross-references, sub-figures, layout panels, hoverable citations and footnotes, callouts, and more.\nA project system for rendering groups of documents at once, sharing options across documents, and producing aggregate output like websites and books.\nAuthoring using a wide variety of editors and notebooks including JupyterLab, RStudio, and VS Code.\nA visual markdown editor that provides a productive writing interface for composing long-form documents.\n\nLearn more about Quarto at https://quarto.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacandrew, S.

With the move to R, this means that our entire teaching of RM is ‘Open source’ and best of class. It’s also cheaper for the student now and for ever, as it can be accessed through a browser, as a pdf, or as a number of different formats depending on taste.\nWe can also make sure that it is Text-reader friendly, dyslexia friendly, colourblind accessible, appropriate in terms of terminology and examples (e.g. Gender/Sexuality) etc.\n\n\nThis is a marketing opportunity\nIf we are able to encapsulate some of the Goldsmiths vibe, it is likely to be a very positive reflection of our programme. We can make a point to include elements that showcase our qualities, and advertise our culture/strengths. The University of Glasgow has won acclaim for their 2017 exercise to move to R and to open teaching resources. Have a look at some of them here. They are pretty cool, but VERY dry - mostly data wrangling and very little actual Psychology… https://psyteachr.github.io/\n\n\n\nCost implication\nA range of free resources will be something that we can be proud to give to our students. If we are able to show that they are also high-quality… winner."

    "text": "Process\n\nRemix\nI propose a ‘Goldsmiths Remix’ of existing resources, assembled from the wide variety of Research Methods, Statistics and general Psychology texts available. With a relatively small amount of effort, an initial version can be produced in the time available.\nRemixing is a recognised and respectable enterprise. The only proviso is that if you choose to remix content, you have to ‘share-alike’ i.e. publish it in a similar open way. I do not see this as a problem.\nWe shall make sure to only remix quality content.\nThere is oodles of Quant and General Psych material to choose from. Qualitative work is a bit thinner on the ground. We have the opportunity to steal a march in this area potentially with an exciting ‘methods neutral’ toolkit.\n\n\nStudent participation\nIdeally we would have students involved in the production of the resources, and make sure that they integrate newer technologies to make them ‘living documents’. Current best practice is to host texts in GitHub repositories, inviting comments or edits, but also to employ social annotation tools (such as Hypothes.is https://web.hypothes.is/) - which allows webpages to be annotated wither publicly or privately, and for communities to be built around what might be considered a static resource.\n\n\nWalking the walk\nAn ideal platform on which to build the book is Quarto, and indeed, due to the relative recency of the RMarkdown to Quarto shift, we will be amongst the first to develop a Psychology offering of this type. And since Quarto is proposed as a platform by which to support student writing, it shows expertise and commitment to what we are training.\n\n\nIf a job’s worth doing…\nWith a little love, humour and creativity we could make our texts (and resources - Lectures/Labs/Datasets etc) more engaging than many others available. Indeed, if we make a concerted effort, it might be that we could"

    "text": "Year 2 (level 5)\n\nModule aims\nExperimental designs in psychology typically employ statistical analyses such as analysis of variance, factor analysis and regression. The aim of this module is to make these topics more accessible through the use of practical examples and data collection on a self-directed group research project.\n\n\nModule Content\nThe module’s overall aim is to offer a supportive and intellectually rigorous environment allowing students to develop highly valuable, transferrable research and collaboration skills in the context of undertaking a group research project.\nThis module teaches fundamental empirical research techniques within the framework of Open Science and reproducibility, promoting best practice in study design, Open Materials and Data, and methodological practice. This module fully immerses students in the Goldsmiths ‘community of practice,’ providing structured research support and opportunities to reflect on learning, modelling the key milestones of the final year dissertation.\nThe module seeks to promote the application of a scientific, intellectually virtuous, research-based approach to any and all future endeavours, and integrates metacognitive and reflective practices to deliver this transformative learning towards academic and personal development.\nOver the course of two terms students will follow a programme of lectures introducing a critical approach to psychological research, as well as how such skills can be transferred beyond psychology; across academic disciplines and into the everyday world, with extensive use of case studies and problem-based learning.\nStructured weekly labs will enable students to work collaboratively to identify an area of research, critically evaluate current research in the area, and develop a modest research project building on these insights.\nStudents will work together, alongside lab tutors and researchers in the department, to design and deliver the research project, including obtaining ethical approval, data collection and analysis, then interpreting and writing up the results, and sharing the materials and data in line with Open Science best practices in the Psychological, Behavioural and Data Sciences.\n\n\nModule Learning Outcomes\n\nShow a critical understanding of research design and methodology\nDesign, conduct, analyse, interpret and disseminate a psychological research project\nUnderstand the conceptual and historical issues concerned with psychology as a science and area of practical application\nDemonstrate valuable time-management and collaborative project-management skills and proficiencies\nReflect on their own learning, skill development and metacognition, preparing them for the final year dissertation\nbe able to use R to analyse: regression, correlations, reliability and validity, effect sizes, one-way within and between subjects designs (and post-hocs), two-way within, between and mixed designs; and factor analysis\nBe able to present reproducible, APA format literate-programmed research reports.\n\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\n\nAssessment Element\nLength\n%\nF or S\nLO Tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading and Resource List\nWe have a custom made textbook to support key study skills throughout your degree:"
