# Overview

## Statistics and Research Methods for Psychological and Behavioural Science

::: callout-warning
General Goldsmiths bollocks
:::

::: callout-important
The Psychology department at Goldsmiths has a number of differentiating
features, upon which it must build in order to ensure it remains
attractive and distinctive.

-   Alchemical, interdisciplinary research programmes and projects
-   Passion for empowering students and producing creative, skillful,
    disruptive agents of change
-   Blend of Art and Science, craft, entrepreneurship, massively
    transferable mind-set/skill-set

Research Methods has to be an adventure, "Alive" with enthusiasm,
inspiring curiosity and intellectual problem-solving.

We have to break the A-Level preconception that Research Methods is dry,
maths-like or indeed difficult.

This must be achieved by: - Practical First - The majority of lab
sessions should be practical and 'hands on'! - Only present
research/methods/topics that are 'ownable' - where we have expertise,
cachet and competitive advantage - and that could NOT be done at
school - 'Relevant & Applicable' above all else. Nothing is taught
'because the BPS says we have to' or that doesn't have widespread use in
a range of future endeavours - Demonstrate and model intellectual
virtue, curiosity, empiricism, skepticism, humility and

AUTHENTIC ASSESSMENT - OPenAI

"Authentic assessment" generally refers to assignments that reflect the
skills students will use in their post-graduation careers and life
experiences (Archbald, 1991; Gulikers et al., 2004). This is distinct
from traditional assessments such as closed-book exams and academic
essays (Macandrew & Edwards, 2002). For psychology, authentic
assessments may involve the development of scientific inquiry skills,
such as a practical research report (Halonen et al., 2003). In clinical
psychology, this can include formulation of case studies or mock
practitioner dialogues (Villarroel et al., 2018). Other examples of
authentic assessments include writing letters to non-psychology
audiences (Cranney, 2013), critical evaluation of media materials
(Halpern & Butler, 2011), written reflections of volunteering
(Hadlington; as cited in Taylor & Hulme, 2015), and research project
interviews (Turner & Davila-Ross, 2015). All of these are designed to
promote psychological literacy by encouraging communication with
non-experts and application of psychology content (Hulme, 2014).

Central to psychological literacy is the effective communication of
psychology in practice (Trapp et al., 2011). To this end, blog writing
may be an effective assessment for capturing and promoting students'
psychological literacy. Blogs are a web-based form of journal or writing
platform, and are useful for disseminating information (Richardson,
2006). They are also increasingly popular for assessing written language
skills (Kim, 2008; Lee, 2010; Raith, 2009; Williams & Jacobs, 2004).
Blog writing may help students take different perspectives, develop a
critical appraisal of content, and become more self-reflective (Frye et
al., 2010; Jimoyiannis & Angelaina, 2012). It also empowers and engages
students (Creme & Hunt, 2002), a core goal of psychology education
(Ishak & Salter, 2017). It enhances academic language learning (Murray
et al., 2007) and assesses different skills than traditional forms of
assessment (Morris et al., 2013). Studies show that students report high
levels of engagement with blog writing (Hindley, 2018).

Blog writing may help students overcome the challenge of academic essay
writing (Ishak & Salter, 2017) since it is less rigidly governed by
academic norms (Bennett et al., 2012) and involves more reflective,
creative, and critical tone (Arslan & Aysel, 2010; Novakovich & Long,
2013). It also provides an opportunity to communicate psychology content
to a wider audience (Gardiner et al., 2018; Schmidt, 2008; Relojo,
2017). It has been embedded successfully in many different subjects in
higher education, such as pharmacy (Dunne & Ryan, 2016), anthropology
(Walker & Chatzigavriil, 2017), professional development (Shanks, 2020),
and English literature (Agarwal, 2017). The British Psychological
Society, 2019 and the American Psychological Association (2013) stress
the importance of critical evaluation and reflection, which is
compatible with blog writing. Research shows that blog writing prompts
critical thinking and reflection (Chretien et al., 2008; Novakovich,
2016). Challenges to implementing blog writing as an assessment include
students having little to no previous experience (Kerawalla et al.,
2009). Blog writing should be grounded effectively in course materials,
have clear expectations, and be understood through a lens of
psychological literacy (Cranney et al., 2008, 2012). We propose that
blog writing may provide a useful opportunity to allow students to apply
their psychology content in a critical, creative, and non-conventional
way.

## BPS website

Research methods Research methods must be delivered at Level 5 or Level
6. Research methods are integral to Psychology and students obtain a
sound knowledge of, and a proven ability to use, a range of methods
appropriately. Knowledge and understanding of how to obtain and analyse
evidence is best acquired and demonstrated through extensive and
progressive empirical work in laboratory and naturalistic settings
through all stages of a degree. \[section 3.4 Subject Benchmark
Statement\] Psychology students learn the basic principles of sound data
collection. Given the broad theoretical scope of Psychology, rigorous
specialist training is required to engender a critical understanding of
the role of experimental design, the choice of research methods
employed, and the analytic approach taken, for testing psychological
theories. \[section 3.5 Subject Benchmark Statement\] Programmes'
coverage of research methods should support students' engagement with
the sub-areas listed above, and should be directed towards supporting
students' attainment of the subject-specific skills highlighted in
section 4.4 of the Subject Benchmark Statement. As they progress through
the programme, students should be able to: • apply multiple perspectives
to psychological issues, recognising that psychology involves a range of
research methods, theories, evidence and applications; • integrate ideas
and findings across the multiple perspectives in psychology and
recognise distinctive psychological approaches to relevant issues; •
identify and evaluate patterns in behaviour, psychological functioning
and experience; • generate and explore hypotheses and research questions
drawing on relevant theory and research; • carry out empirical studies
involving a variety of methods of data collection, including
experiments, observation, questionnaires, interviews and focus groups; •
analyse, present and evaluate quantitative and qualitative data and
evaluate research findings; • employ evidence-based reasoning and
examine practical, theoretical and ethical issues associated with the
range of methodologies; • use a variety of psychological tools,
including specialist software, laboratory equipment and psychometric
instruments; • apply psychological knowledge ethically and safely to
real world problems; and • critically evaluate psychological theory and
research.

ability to formulate and communicate well-reasoned, evidence-based, and
statistically defensible arguments based on their expertise in the study
of human behavior and its causes. On top of this, psychology graduates
possess the skills to work independently or collaboratively, as well as
strong numerical capabilities, verbal and written communication skills,
and an up-to-date knowledge of digital technologies applicable to a wide
range of occupational fields.

OPENAI of below

McGovern et al. (2010) define psychological literacy as 'being
insightful and reflective about one's own and others' behaviour and
mental processes' (p.11). This concept captures the ability of a
psychology student to apply the knowledge and skills gained during their
education to all aspects of life, such as the workplace, personal life,
and wider social context. Cranney et al. (2012, p.4) adopt a similar
definition of psychological literacy as 'the general capacity to
adaptively and intentionally apply psychology to meet personal,
professional and societal needs'. Dunn (2009) further explains that
psychologically literate people are able to use psychology to solve
issues on a local, civic, and national level by looking to data instead
of personal opinion.

In order to promote psychological literacy, Dunn et al. (2011) and Mair
et al. (2013) suggest that the applications of psychology should be
recognised and taught in a real-world context; Biggs (1996) recommends
that courses should be constructively aligned to explicitly include
psychological literacy in the learning outcomes and assessments; and
Akhurst et al. (in press), Bernstein (2011), Cranney and Dunn (2011),
McGovern (2011) and Zinkiewicz et al. (2003) suggest that psychological
literacy should be modelled in professional lives through interactions
with colleagues and students, and by using psychology to inform teaching
practices, solve problems, and ensure inclusivity.

-   ::: callout-note
    -   McGovern et al. (2010) defines psychological literacy as 'being
        insightful and reflective about one's own and others behaviour
        and mental processes' (p.11). It is, in essence, the general
        capacity to apply psychological knowledge to real-world
        scenarios.

    -   Dunn (2009) discusses this, claiming that 'psychologically
        literate people can use what they know about psychology to solve
        home-based, local, civic, and even national matters by looking
        to data instead of personal opinion'.

    -   McGovern et al. (2010, p.11) define psychological literacy as
        'being insightful and reflective about one's own and others'
        behaviour and mental processes' and having the ability to apply
        'psychological principles to personal, social, and
        organizational issues in work, relationships and the broader
        community'. Cranney et al. (2012, p.4) adopt a similar stance,
        describing psychological literacy as 'the general capacity to
        adaptively and intentionally apply psychology to meet personal,
        professional and societal needs'. The concept of psychological
        literacy thus captures the ability of a psychology student to
        apply the knowledge and skills that they acquire during their
        education to all aspects of life: the workplace, their personal
        lives and the wider social context. As such, psychological
        literacy may provide a lens through which we can view the wider
        benefits of psychology education. It may also hold out some hope
        to students who may be coming to accept that their aspirations
        towards a career in psychology are likely to remain unfulfilled,
        but who remain enthused and inspired by the subject, and are
        looking for ways to continue to stay in touch with it.

    -   We need to:\
        I    recognise and to teach the applications of psychology, its
        relevance to the real world and the transferability of skills,
        rather than always teaching it in a theoretical context (Dunn et
        al., 2011; Mair et al., 2013);\
        I    constructively align (Biggs, 1996) our courses to
        explicitly include psychological literacy in our learning
        outcomes, our teaching, and the assessments that we give to our
        students (Dunn et al., 2011; Trapp, 2010; Trapp et al., 2011);\
        I    model psychological literacy in our own professional lives,
        through our interactions with colleagues and students, using
        psychology to inform our teaching practices, solve problems and
        ensure inclusivity (Akhurst et al., in press; Bernstein, 2011;
