Goldsmiths as a college bullshit -

Goldsmiths as a department - differentiation, unique properties - Interdisciplinary and methodologically rigorous and creative. Industry links and all that jazz.

We embrace an Open Science approach in our efforts to cultivate your critical evaluation skills, enhance your understanding of the significance - and power - of research, and equip you with the necessary graduate-level skills to collect, handle, and interpret data using programming software for statistical model development, visualisation and analysis.

Through lectures, interactive group discussions, online skills development modules, and practical lab sessions, we will ignite your enthusiasm for Psychology and Behavioural Science research and help you develop the fundamental skills, knowledge - and confidence - required to become a Psychology literate, disruptive scientist of the future. Tada!

Communicate complex information effectively using appropriate written, oral, graphical and electronic means, taking into account diversity among individuals to whom the information is communicated.

Explain the potential impact of psychological research and theory on a broad range of real world settings and situations (e.g., classrooms, industry, commerce, healthcare, as well as local and global communities).

Problem-solve and reason scientifically. Specifically, graduates will be able to identify and pose research questions, consider alternative approaches to their solutions, and evaluate outcomes.

Be sensitive to contextual and interpersonal factors. Graduates will be familiar with the complexity of the factors that shape behaviour and social interaction which, in turn, will make them more aware of the bases of problems and interpersonal conflicts.

or Be a self-critical learner, showing sensitivity to contextual and interpersonal factors. Graduates will be familiar with the complexity of the factors that shape behaviour and social interaction which, in turn, will make them more aware of the bases of problems and interpersonal conflicts.

Show an understanding of various research paradigms, methods, and evaluation procedures, including statistical analysis, as well as their constraints.

Design, carry out, evaluate and interpret scientifically rigorous and ethically sound studies both independently and collaboratively, utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods, statistical analysis and modern digital software.

Psychological literacy is the ability to understand and apply psychological principles and theories to everyday life. This includes the ability to understand how psychological processes and phenomena influence our behavior, emotions, thoughts, and relationships. It also includes the capacity to use psychological knowledge to make informed decisions and to better understand, explain, and predict the behavior of self and others.

Psychology graduates are highly sought after by employers due to their ability to formulate and communicate well-reasoned, evidence-based, and statistically defensible arguments based on their expertise in the study of human behavior and its causes. On top of this, psychology graduates possess the skills to work independently or collaboratively, as well as strong numerical capabilities, verbal and written communication skills, and an up-to-date knowledge of digital technologies applicable to a wide range of occupational fields.

## Programme Overview

### Pre-Arrival onwards / Onboarding

Showcase in Induction week - Staff labs and research projects for the year.

Year One students self-test

MSc Students - ditto and ability to shop around for supervision

Year 2 develop their pods? Show Y1 and Foundations what they did last year

Year 3/MSc students - Research Bootcamp and refreshers/skills workshops

Support PhD students and staff

### Shock and Awe - Shatter the A-Level preconceptions

### Vertically Integrated Projects via 'Labs'

### HeartData week (recruitment & forward prep)

Potentially Reading Week Term 2? Or week before/after?

Allows all levels of students to blitz data and to showcase their work for external stakeholders and to make a department-wide event.
