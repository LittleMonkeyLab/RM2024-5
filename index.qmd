Below is an example of an executed code chunk - in html format clicking
on ![](images/image-1563023320.png){width="150" height="27"}would unfold
the code that drives the plot and results summary. In pdf format, it's
unfolded and printed.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

library(ggplot2)                                # <1>
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) +          # <2>
  geom_point() + # <3>                               
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) # <3>

library(psych) # <4>
describe(airquality, na.rm = TRUE, skew = FALSE, ranges = FALSE) # <4>

```
1. Load graphics package `ggplot`, and then
2. ask for a plot of `airquality data` specifically columns `Temp` and `Ozone` as axes on the plot, 3. specify a scatterplot with a loess trend line
4. finally describe the variables `Ozone` and `Temp` with `describe()` function from `psych` toolkit - i.e. fivenumber summary (n, mean, sd, median)

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |>                                      # <1>
  mutate(                                        # <2>
    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm, # <2>
    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm  # <2>
  )                                              # <2>
```
1. Take `penguins`, and then,
2. add new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.

The Psychology department at Goldsmiths has a number of differentiating
features, upon which it must build in order to ensure it remains
attractive and distinctive.

-   Alchemical, interdisciplinary research programmes and projects
-   Passion for empowering students and producing creative, skillful,
    disruptive agents of change
-   Blend of Art and Science, craft, entrepreneurship, massively
    transferable mind-set/skill-set

Research Methods has to be an adventure, "Alive" with enthusiasm,
inspiring curiosity and intellectual problem-solving.

We have to break the A-Level preconception that Research Methods is dry,
maths-like or indeed difficult.

This must be achieved by: - Practical First - The majority of lab
sessions should be practical and 'hands on'! - Only present
research/methods/topics that are 'ownable' - where we have expertise,
cachet and competitive advantage - and that could NOT be done at
school - 'Relevant & Applicable' above all else. Nothing is taught
'because the BPS says we have to' or that doesn't have widespread use in
a range of future endeavours - Demonstrate and model intellectual
virtue, curiosity, empiricism, skepticism, humility and

AUTHENTIC ASSESSMENT - OPenAI

"Authentic assessment" generally refers to assignments that reflect the
skills students will use in their post-graduation careers and life
experiences (Archbald, 1991; Gulikers et al., 2004). This is distinct
from traditional assessments such as closed-book exams and academic
essays (Macandrew & Edwards, 2002). For psychology, authentic
assessments may involve the development of scientific inquiry skills,
such as a practical research report (Halonen et al., 2003). In clinical
psychology, this can include formulation of case studies or mock
practitioner dialogues (Villarroel et al., 2018). Other examples of
authentic assessments include writing letters to non-psychology
audiences (Cranney, 2013), critical evaluation of media materials
(Halpern & Butler, 2011), written reflections of volunteering
(Hadlington; as cited in Taylor & Hulme, 2015), and research project
interviews (Turner & Davila-Ross, 2015). All of these are designed to
promote psychological literacy by encouraging communication with
non-experts and application of psychology content (Hulme, 2014).

Central to psychological literacy is the effective communication of
psychology in practice (Trapp et al., 2011). To this end, blog writing
may be an effective assessment for capturing and promoting students'
psychological literacy. Blogs are a web-based form of journal or writing
platform, and are useful for disseminating information (Richardson,
2006). They are also increasingly popular for assessing written language
skills (Kim, 2008; Lee, 2010; Raith, 2009; Williams & Jacobs, 2004).
Blog writing may help students take different perspectives, develop a
critical appraisal of content, and become more self-reflective (Frye et
al., 2010; Jimoyiannis & Angelaina, 2012). It also empowers and engages
students (Creme & Hunt, 2002), a core goal of psychology education
(Ishak & Salter, 2017). It enhances academic language learning (Murray
et al., 2007) and assesses different skills than traditional forms of
assessment (Morris et al., 2013). Studies show that students report high
levels of engagement with blog writing (Hindley, 2018).

Blog writing may help students overcome the challenge of academic essay
writing (Ishak & Salter, 2017) since it is less rigidly governed by
academic norms (Bennett et al., 2012) and involves more reflective,
creative, and critical tone (Arslan & Aysel, 2010; Novakovich & Long,
2013). It also provides an opportunity to communicate psychology content
to a wider audience (Gardiner et al., 2018; Schmidt, 2008; Relojo,
2017). It has been embedded successfully in many different subjects in
higher education, such as pharmacy (Dunne & Ryan, 2016), anthropology
(Walker & Chatzigavriil, 2017), professional development (Shanks, 2020),
and English literature (Agarwal, 2017). The British Psychological
Society, 2019 and the American Psychological Association (2013) stress
the importance of critical evaluation and reflection, which is
compatible with blog writing. Research shows that blog writing prompts
critical thinking and reflection (Chretien et al., 2008; Novakovich,
2016). Challenges to implementing blog writing as an assessment include
students having little to no previous experience (Kerawalla et al.,
2009). Blog writing should be grounded effectively in course materials,
have clear expectations, and be understood through a lens of
psychological literacy (Cranney et al., 2008, 2012). We propose that
blog writing may provide a useful opportunity to allow students to apply
their psychology content in a critical, creative, and non-conventional
way.

Research methods Research methods must be delivered at Level 5 or Level
6. Research methods are integral to Psychology and students obtain a
sound knowledge of, and a proven ability to use, a range of methods
appropriately. Knowledge and understanding of how to obtain and analyse
evidence is best acquired and demonstrated through extensive and
progressive empirical work in laboratory and naturalistic settings
through all stages of a degree. \[section 3.4 Subject Benchmark
Statement\] Psychology students learn the basic principles of sound data
collection. Given the broad theoretical scope of Psychology, rigorous
specialist training is required to engender a critical understanding of
the role of experimental design, the choice of research methods
employed, and the analytic approach taken, for testing psychological
theories. \[section 3.5 Subject Benchmark Statement\] Programmes'
coverage of research methods should support students' engagement with
the sub-areas listed above, and should be directed towards supporting
students' attainment of the subject-specific skills highlighted in
section 4.4 of the Subject Benchmark Statement. As they progress through
the programme, students should be able to: â€¢ apply multiple perspectives
to psychological issues, recognising that psychology involves a range of
research methods, theories, evidence and applications; â€¢ integrate ideas
and findings across the multiple perspectives in psychology and
recognise distinctive psychological approaches to relevant issues; â€¢
identify and evaluate patterns in behaviour, psychological functioning
and experience; â€¢ generate and explore hypotheses and research questions
drawing on relevant theory and research; â€¢ carry out empirical studies
involving a variety of methods of data collection, including
experiments, observation, questionnaires, interviews and focus groups; â€¢
analyse, present and evaluate quantitative and qualitative data and
evaluate research findings; â€¢ employ evidence-based reasoning and
examine practical, theoretical and ethical issues associated with the
range of methodologies; â€¢ use a variety of psychological tools,
including specialist software, laboratory equipment and psychometric
instruments; â€¢ apply psychological knowledge ethically and safely to
real world problems; and â€¢ critically evaluate psychological theory and
research.

Communicate complex information effectively using appropriate written,
oral, graphical and electronic means, taking into account diversity
among individuals to whom the information is communicated.

Explain the potential impact of psychological research and theory on a
broad range of real world settings and situations (e.g., classrooms,
industry, commerce, healthcare, as well as local and global
communities).

Problem-solve and reason scientifically. Specifically, graduates will be
able to identify and pose research questions, consider alternative
approaches to their solutions, and evaluate outcomes.

Be sensitive to contextual and interpersonal factors. Graduates will be
familiar with the complexity of the factors that shape behaviour and
social interaction which, in turn, will make them more aware of the
bases of problems and interpersonal conflicts.

or Be a self-critical learner, showing sensitivity to contextual and
interpersonal factors. Graduates will be familiar with the complexity of
the factors that shape behaviour and social interaction which, in turn,
will make them more aware of the bases of problems and interpersonal
conflicts.

Show an understanding of various research paradigms, methods, and
evaluation procedures, including statistical analysis, as well as their
constraints.

Design, carry out, evaluate and interpret scientifically rigorous and
ethically sound studies both independently and collaboratively,
utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods, statistical analysis and
modern digital software.

Psychological literacy is the ability to understand and apply
psychological principles and theories to everyday life. This includes
the ability to understand how psychological processes and phenomena
influence our behavior, emotions, thoughts, and relationships. It also
includes the capacity to use psychological knowledge to make informed
decisions and to better understand, explain, and predict the behavior of
self and others.

Psychology graduates are highly sought after by employers due to their
ability to formulate and communicate well-reasoned, evidence-based, and
statistically defensible arguments based on their expertise in the study
of human behavior and its causes. On top of this, psychology graduates
possess the skills to work independently or collaboratively, as well as
strong numerical capabilities, verbal and written communication skills,
and an up-to-date knowledge of digital technologies applicable to a wide
range of occupational fields.

### Technical Overview

![R language](images/R_logo.png){width="65"}

R is primarily a computer programming language for statistical analysis.
It is *free*, and *open-source* (many people contribute to developing
it), and runs on most operating systems or through an internet browser,
and so there are few obstacles to its use by the normal undergraduate
population (compare to SPSS).

It is a powerful language that can be used for all sorts of mathematical
operations, data-processing, analysis, and graphical display of data -
it is used more a more frequently in corporate settings, unlike 'pay to
play' software such as SPSS.

I even used R to write this lab manual. And, I use R all the time for my
own research, because it makes data-analyis fast, efficient,
transparent, reproducible, and exciting
