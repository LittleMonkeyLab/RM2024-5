# Research Skills

The Psychology department at Goldsmiths has a number of differentiating
features, upon which it must build in order to ensure it remains
attractive and distinctive.

-   Alchemical, interdisciplinary research programmes and projects
-   Passion for empowering students and producing creative, skillful,
    disruptive agents of change
-   Blend of Art and Science, craft, entrepreneurship, massively
    transferable mind-set/skill-set

Research Methods has to be an adventure, "Alive" with enthusiasm,
inspiring curiosity and intellectual problem-solving.

We have to break the A-Level preconception that Research Methods is dry,
maths-like or indeed difficult.

This must be achieved by: - Practical First - The majority of lab
sessions should be practical and 'hands on'! - Only present
research/methods/topics that are 'ownable' - where we have expertise,
cachet and competitive advantage - and that could NOT be done at
school - 'Relevant & Applicable' above all else. Nothing is taught
'because the BPS says we have to' or that doesn't have widespread use in
a range of future endeavours - Demonstrate and model intellectual
virtue, curiosity, empiricism, skepticism, humility and

Psychology can be a stimulating and joyful endeavour, and learning it is
best achieved in a safe, but challenging environment.

::: callout
Psychology is a diverse and highly interdisciplinary field of study that
involves the varied application of systematic methods of inquiry to the
exploration of behavior, mental processes, and social relationships.

As a department we support students in discovering the core knowledge
and skills of the field of psychology, extending a history and tradition
of widening participation, respecting diverse viewpoints and methods and
forging important connections with other disciplines and areas of
practice.

It is our mission to promote intellectual virtue and inspire curiosity,
creativity, critical and analytic thinking in all our students.

Across our exciting portfolio of programmes, we strive to create an
open, supportive, challenging and dynamic learning environment. We share
our passion for psychology through close and active mentorship and
support in labs, lecture halls and beyond.

We believe that the best way to train these virtues is by modelling
them, and so we invest heavily in giving students access to our active
research groups, we encourage and support students in finding a
psychology that is relevant to them and gives them agency to solve
whatever challenges they choose to address.

At a departmental level we consider the following to be crucial

**1)** Demonstrate understanding and competence regarding the use of
research methodology in psychology from across the range of Qualitative
and Quantitative technique, and use them to collect high quality data.

**2)** Skillfully analyse and correctly interpret data using appropriate
techniques and tools in a Open and Reproducible way.

**3)** Communicate complex ideas and empirical results clearly,
succinctly, and in a range of relevant media and contexts.

**4)** To appreciate the broad and important application of Psychology.

**5)** Demonstrate a clear understanding of key concepts, theoretical
approaches, empirical results, and historical debates in the field of
Psychology.

**6)** Develop meta-learning, meta-cognitive and reflective skills
suitable to support a life of learning.

**7)** Recognize, understand, respect and champion diversity,
inclusivity and stuff.

**8)** Reflect on the ethical imperatives of Psychological practice and
research, and be an agent for good.

## Weekly structure (all levels)

### 2 hours lecture (+1 hour pre-reading)

We moved to 1 hour (from 2) during the pandemic, and it has severely
limited the amount that can be reasonably covered. In addition to
doubling the lecture time (as is merited by credit weighting alone), we
propose to introduce a weekly expectation that an hour is spent reading
in preparation for the following session.

This could be diverted to other preparatory activities, but the
expectation will be clearly set that a MINIMUM of an hour of preparation
is expected for every lecture.

### 2 hours lab (+1 hour pre-reading)

Labs are valuable practical sessions and a similar expectation exists
that a student will have completed whatever preparation is expected. Of
course, we understand if things don't always go to plan, so if you can,
please do turn up, but by being prepared, and understanding the activity
being conducted, the learning outcomes are far more achievable.

It will often be the case the the preparation is mostly 'setting the
scene', or giving detailed instructions about what will be happening
that are better delivered in writing, or clarifying what you will be
expected to have done or produced by the end of the lab.

In this module, it is easier to 'keep up than catch up' and so if

### 2 hours Interactive Data Skills Tutorials (with short weekly assessment)

Think of this as focussed time students are dedicated to working on
their computers, and so anything that sits within the browser is fair
game here. It's NOT just Stats. Library skills, literature searching,
learning logs and portfolios, as well as collaborative writing or
finding information.

Since the programme will employ an Open Educational Resource Online
Textbook as the central resource for Lectures and Labs, this means that
the notional 4 hours of 'screen time' allocated to this module may often
be closely aligned, but it will also be the case that a wide range of
activity types will be trained and developed, including the Goldsmiths
Library and their extensive online resources, also extensive use of
Posit Cloud will be made, the hub where students will produce technical
reports, blogs and webpages, conduct data analysis and collaborate on
coding and writing exercises.

## A few words on Assessment

"Authentic assessment" generally refers to assignments that reflect the
skills students will use in their post-graduation careers and life more
generally. This is distinct from traditional assessments such as
closed-book exams and academic essays.

For psychology, authentic assessments may involve the development of
traditional science communication skills, such as lab reports, however
there is a broader portfolio to choose from! In clinical psychology,
Authentic challenges could include formulation of case studies or mock
practitioner dialogues. Common challneges for many professions include
writing for non-expert audiences, critical evaluation of media materials
or the production of media materials that are rigorous... Reflective
accounts and portfolios are part of a number of later training roles and
research interviews are a hugely powerful transferable skill! All of
these are designed to promote psychological literacy by encouraging
communication with non-experts and application of psychology content.

blog writing may be an effective assessment for capturing and promoting
students' psychological literacy. They are also increasingly popular for
assessing writing ability and conceptual knowledge. Blog writing may
help students take different perspectives, develop a critical appraisal
of content, and become more reflective. Given the currency of blogging
and the fact that it is a core channel for marketing and social media -
it a rich target that assesses a distinctive set of skills. Students
seem to enjoy it too.

Blog writing may help students overcome the challenge of academic essay
writing (Ishak & Salter, 2017) since it is less rigidly governed by
academic norms (Bennett et al., 2012) and involves more reflective,
creative, and critical tone (Arslan & Aysel, 2010; Novakovich & Long,
2013). It also provides an opportunity to communicate psychology content
to a wider audience (Gardiner et al., 2018; Schmidt, 2008; Relojo,
2017). It has been embedded successfully in many different subjects in
higher education, such as pharmacy (Dunne & Ryan, 2016), anthropology
(Walker & Chatzigavriil, 2017), professional development (Shanks, 2020),
and English literature (Agarwal, 2017). The British Psychological
Society, 2019 and the American Psychological Association (2013) stress
the importance of critical evaluation and reflection, which is
compatible with blog writing. Research shows that blog writing prompts
critical thinking and reflection (Chretien et al., 2008; Novakovich,
2016). Challenges to implementing blog writing as an assessment include
students having little to no previous experience (Kerawalla et al.,
2009). Blog writing should be grounded effectively in course materials,
have clear expectations, and be understood through a lens of
psychological literacy (Cranney et al., 2008, 2012). We propose that
blog writing may provide a useful opportunity to allow students to apply
their psychology content in a critical, creative, and non-conventional
way.

### Technical Overview

![R language](images/R_logo.png){width="65"}

R is primarily a computer programming language for statistical analysis.
It is *free*, and *open-source* (many people contribute to developing
it), and runs on most operating systems or through an internet browser,
and so there are few obstacles to its use by the normal undergraduate
population (compare to SPSS).

It is a powerful language that can be used for all sorts of mathematical
operations, data-processing, analysis, and graphical display of data -
it is used more a more frequently in corporate settings, unlike 'pay to
play' software such as SPSS.

I even used R to write this lab manual. And, I use R all the time for my
own research, because it makes data-analyis fast, efficient,
transparent, reproducible, and exciting

![Posit <br/> (Formerly RStudio)](images/posit_logo.png){width="50"}

Posit is name of the Integrated Development Environment in which the R
Language (and Python/Julia/Observable+) are run. It is Open Source and
offers free access to everyone.

Posit Cloud is a paid-for service that allows users to access the Posit
environment without downloading anything - it's browser based, and you
can run analysis and create publication-ready documents on your phone.

Posit Cloud would likely be my suggestion as to the infrastructure we
employ.

Free accounts are available to all students for a processing duration of
25 project hours per month, with free hosting of published content.
Instructors pay a small amount, and it can be arranged that payment is
made by student, instructor or organisation if a student were to exceed
their Posit Cloud allowance.

The point is important to make however, that energised users simply have
to download and install the free software and they can use it as much as
they want, thus the high-rate users usually, very quickly, wean
themselves off the browser-based platform.

The Posit Cloud has classroom functionality and is designed to deliver
teaching, tutorials and content
